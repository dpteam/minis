A minimalist social network made from scratch

*simpson* (*simp*le *so*cial *n*etwork) is my attempt at creating a minimalist social networking software. I'd like to introduce as little bloat as possible, regarding both architecture and features.

This is really just for fun &mdash; I have no goal in mind, and frankly, no idea where this is going.

## Design guidelines
This is what I'm loosely trying to follow:

* As little overhead as possible. Frameworks that impose a structure are to be avoided at all costs, libraries are fine if they're not too obtrusive and make the rest of the code less unwieldy.
* As few features as possible, while still deserving the name "social networking software". More features can always be added later if they don't introduce too much clutter.
* Readable and elegant code, whatever that may mean.
* Desktop first, responsiveness as an afterthought.
* Initially, no special focus on security.

## License and usage and stuff
*simpson* is a "why the hell did i start this" kind of project, and I don't presently care what will become of it when it's finished. Use it, fork it, improve it, no credit or anything required, be my guest. (That's assuming this receives any attention in the first place.)
